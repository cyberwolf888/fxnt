        <p><b>Q:</b> <b>Why is your system called FX NEWS TRADER 999?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the following reasons:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">BASE PRICE:                             </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">999</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">USD</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUCCESS CHANCE:</span>                 <span style="font-weight: 400;">99.9</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">%</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:</span>   <span style="font-weight: 400;">99.9 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <b>Does the system work on any broker and account type?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We tested the system on about 25 brokers and only about 15 accounts were profitable, so the chances are about 60% that your broker/account type is the right one.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the EA up to 5 accounts (or more later) so test it and at least 2-3 accounts should be profitable.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no system that is ALWAYS profitable on all accounts or brokers, you must be realistic and take your best chance of winning. There is never 100% profitable system or EA.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the system with the brokers we use, check “</span><a href="{{ route('brokers') }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>BROKERS</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” page for further information.</span></p>
        <p><b>Q: If the FX News trades only during news so there are very few trades per month, right?</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A:</strong> The FX News is designed to trade MAINLY during news times since it can make almost “sure” profits and earn many pips. But it’s possible to trade also during high volatility periods when there are no news, so in fact it opens quite many orders, on average 30-35 per week which is not so little. Besides we use high order size of 5.0 or more lots since the Stop Loss is very low, so there is little risk of losing much capital in one trade.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can simply login to the account on our </span><a href="{{ route('home') }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>HOME </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">page to see by yourself how many trades per week or months there are.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also check the </span><a href="{{ route('method') }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>METHOD </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">page (last entry in the table: “Other Parameters”) and you will see that you can trade not only during news times, but also during other periods as well.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Robot is called </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="{{ route('home') }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>FX NEWS TRADER 999 &#8211; Forex News &amp; Volatility EA</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which means that it can trade during both news and high volatility times.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can make around 100%-500% profits per months, sometimes more. You can check </span><a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/fxnt999_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>MYFXBOOK </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement for Real and Demo results.</span></p>
        <p><b>Q: Why is it better than other EAs?</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A: </strong>It’s</span><b> very profitable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up to 500% profits per month</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It cannot lose much money on one (or more) trades</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It executes few trades per day, but </span><b>most of them are profitable</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative trades are usually 5-7 pips, positive trades are usually 25-50 pips or more.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trades are open only for a short period of time, up to 30 minutes</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works with many brokers on Live accounts and our </span><b>results are verified on <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/fxnt999_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MYFXBOOK</a></b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During news times there are </span><b>very high spikes in prices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so if the price is predicted correctly, the EA can win many pips, if the price is predicted wrong, it loses only a few pips triggered by a tight stop loss</span></p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <b>Why can’t I see any open or pending orders now?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Most (but not all) systems have trades open for many hours or days and most traders are used to see open orders or pending orders when they login to the accounts with those systems.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in case of FX News the trades are open on average for about 15-30 minutes only and the next trade can take place in a few hours or even a few days, that’s why you might be “unlucky” and not see any trades open.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wait long enough you will see eventually some of them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also watch </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DTbLh5dYpJn65qDY0SuNg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>VIDEOS</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with some of the trades we recorded to give you an idea how our system works.</span></p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <b>Do you give any discounts?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we don’t give any discounts or negotiate the prices. However, we give 99.9-Day Money Back Guarantee so you can purchase the EA and if you are not happy, you can get the money back if you cannot succeed.</span></p>
